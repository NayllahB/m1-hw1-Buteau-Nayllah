## About Me ##
Hello! My name is Nayllah Buteau and I graduated last December from the University of Central Florida with my B.S.B.A in Marketing. I currently work full-time at a media agency where I focus in managing digital investment funds for media campaigns. I enjoy traveling, listening to music, and watching movies/tv shows. I am excited to start my journey at UF and learn about web design!

## Past Coding Experience ##
I have very minor coding experience with C++ from my first semester of undergrad when I was a compsci major, but I switched majors pretty early on so I remember very little.

## Career Goals ##
1. Increase knowledge in web design and important components needed to build resposive and cool websites.
2. Learn about UX/UI design theory.
3. Graduate with MAMC in Web Design.
4. Obtain role in UX design.
